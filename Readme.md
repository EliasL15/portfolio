# Elias Liassides - Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built using the React framework. The website serves as a platform to showcase my skills, experiences, and projects as a software engineer. It includes information about my background, technical expertise, work experiences, and the projects I have worked on. The goal is to demonstrate my capabilities in software development and highlight the projects I've contributed to.
